# **<center>Untamed: Cortical parcellation using overlapping spatial maps from tensor decomposition on resting-state fMRI with graph representation learning </center>**

## Introduction

Spontaneous brain activity is an important biomarker for various neurological and psychological conditions and can be measured using resting functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Since brain activity during rest is spontaneous, it is not possible to directly compare rfMRI time-courses across subjects. Here we developed a group extension of the pair-wise BrainSync transform (GBS), that jointly synchronizes resting or task fMRI data across time for multiple subjects. Pair-wise Brainsync was applied to bring a group of subjects into alignment with a single representative subject. This tends to bias subsequent analysis towards the individual characteristics of the representative subject. Here we define a group approach in which orthogonal transforms are applied to each subject to match to an unbiased group average.

This page provides a MATLAB implementation of the GBS described in
